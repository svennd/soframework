##  MISSION
##############
#	SOF is a simple framework designed for starting/midrange programmers who want to
#	build a custom application without having to worry about the basic structures
#	like a member system, database management, session handling, ... We like to give our users
#	the ability to simply build what they like to make. Without having to worry about
#	side tracks. We also hope that these programmers make full usage of the flexibility
# 	and extendable methods we applied through the entire framework.
#

##############
##  PROGRESS
##############
#	SOF is build from the scratch and some big features are still missing. We don't intend
#	to take over the world. We know some other frameworks are better in some cases.
#	This however doesn't stop us from continue extend and enhance SOF.
#

##CORE MODULES
##############
#	Core modules are not (anymore) different from other modules. The only thing that 
#	separates the "normal modules" is the fact that core modules are included in the
#	download packs. And will always be supported out-of-the-box. These modules are :
#	- session handling
#	- database handling (MySQL)
#	- user system
#	- view system (basic layout, template)
#

##DEVELOPMENT

#	SOF is made by Svenn D'Hert and is foremost a tool for personal use.
#	However everyone is free to use & share under the GNU v2 license.
