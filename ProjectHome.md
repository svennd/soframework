## Mission ##
| Single Object Framework (SOF) is a simple, small footprint framework, designed for mainly smaller personal projects. Its aim is to reduce time spending doing stuff that is easy but still takes allot of time to make.|
|:-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|

**simple** <br />
Its build in one object, and you are able to name it whatever you want, 1 include and 1 initialize to use the framework. Can't get any shorter now can it ;)
```
<?php
include('_main/main_frame.php');
 
# initialize page
$core = new core();

// your code
```

**fast** <br />
Out-of-the-box gives you session handling, user management, database handling, templates, ...

**modular** <br />
Its build in modules, you can add or remove whatever module you want to add, prefer to write non-oop ? no restrictions from this framework !


**free** <br />
As in free beer ? mostly, GNU GPLv2 ;)

## Version ##
Our first release was on 31 December 2010, our latest (Alpha 2.1) 7 February 2013. Go see our code trunk for the latest version.<br /><br />
_I use this code in allot of projects and tools, and though I tried to make everything bug-free and safe, I cannot be held account for possible mistakes and the possible money or data loss should you use this software. Though backups would save you, don't try to blame me. I think its pretty fancy code... really fancy._
